**New minor version version::``0.6.0-beta`` of ¨tnsana:** see the new feature below.


**Explicit definition of a function:** two new features have been added.

    1) A new macro ``\txtfuncdef`` can be used to print a short textual version.

    1) Missing sets can be indicated via an empty argument with the macros ``\funcdef[h]`` and ``\txtfuncdef``.


**Parametrized functions:** the macros ``\expb`` and ``\logb`` have been replaced simply by ``\exp`` and ``\log`` which have an optional argument to indicate a base.


**Partial derivation:** it is now possible to use ``\pder[ei]`` with indexed variables.


**Internal machinery:** here are the changes.

    1) The use of booleans from ¨etoolbox has been limited for really needed cases.

    2) The draw of axes for decorated tables of signs has been factorized.


**Documentation:** the section about symbolic variables has been updated to the last version of ¨tnscom.

**Internal machinery for the documentation:** the ¨python file path::``build-01-dep[slow].py`` updates automatically a ¨tex file with all the packages used by ¨tnsana.

**Internal machinery for the technical ¨infos:** the printing uses now ¨macroenvsign the new version of ¨cbdevtools (this tool is still in alpha version).

**New minor version version::``0.5.0-beta`` of ¨tnsana:** see the new feature below.


**Explicit definition of a function:** three kinds of formatting are proposed.

**New minor version version::``0.4.0-beta`` of ¨tnsana:** see the new feature and two little bacward incompatibilities just below.


**Limit :** this new feature is just for single variable functions.


**Integration:** for the sake of consistency, two signatures have changed.

    1) ``\integrate{f}{x}{a}{b}`` must be used instead of ``\integrate{a}{b}{f}{x}``.

    1) ``\hook{f}{x}{a}{b}`` must be used instead of ``\hook{a}{b}{f}{x}``.


**Differential calculus:** for the sake of consistency, the signature of ``\der`` has moved from ``\der{f}{n}{x}`` to ``\der{f}{x}{n}``.


**Internal machinery for the technical ¨infos:** the builder is better but still not the best one...

==========

**New minor version version::``0.3.0-beta`` of ¨tnsana:** see all the new features below.


**Derivation :** two new features have been added.

    1) Two dot versions of the total derivation can be used thanks to the options `b` and `db` of `\der`.

    1) Physicist notation ``u_xxx`` can be printed by using the option `ei` of `\pder`.


**Table of signs or variations :** here are the last changes.

    1) A new global setting is used : the double spacing of double vertcial rule is `3pt` now.

    1) A new macro ``\backLine`` allows to change the background color of several lines.

    1) ``\graphSign`` use thicker curves and can plot the reference functions `x^2`, `sqrt x`, `1/x`, `abs x`, `exp x` and `ln x`.


**Documentation :** the ¨tikz examples have been put outside the ¨tex files.

==========

**New minor version version::``0.2.0-beta`` of ¨tnsana:** see the new feature below.


**Symbolic variable :** one new macro `\symvar` can be used to indicate variables in functional operators for example (this macro comes directly from ¨tnscom).

==========

**New minor version version::``0.1.0-beta`` of ¨tnsana:** see the new feature below.


**Named function :** the french named functions `ppcm` and `pgcd` have been moved to ¨tnsarith and `lcm`has been added because this is not included in ¨latex by default.


==========
2020-07-10
==========

**First version version::``0.0.0-beta`` of ¨tnsana:** this package tries to simplify the writting of basic analysis.

warning::
    This package uses the package `tnscom`.
